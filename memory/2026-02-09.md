## Project: Chevel Yavne GIS Data Collection
Andrey requested specific planning layers and statuses for the Chevel Yavne area:
1. **Ashdod Master Plan (In preparation):** Identified as plan **603-0453118** (Comprehensive Master Plan). Currently in pre-deposit stages.
2. **Yavne Master Plan:** Identified as plan **422-0268516** (Comprehensive Master Plan). Status: **Approved/Effective** (since 2018).
3. **Kfar Aviv:** Located within Gederot Regional Council. Searching for relevant local/master plans.
4. **Jurisdiction Boundaries & Ashdod Urban Planning Space (Makam):** Using Govmap and ArcGIS to identify boundaries adjacent to Chevel Yavne.

## Technical Notes
- Active sessions using Chrome browser relay (profile="chrome") to access Mavat (SV1), Govmap, and ArcGIS.
- Encountering intermittent communication errors with browser tabs (tab not found/service reachability), but overcoming by re-opening or refreshing targets.
- Brave Search API currently returning 422 (invalid token), relying on browser-based search and direct portal navigation.
