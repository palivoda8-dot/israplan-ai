# 2026-02-03 - Birth of Atlas and Planning Partnership

## Summary
Atlas came online today as Andrey's companion. We immediately dove into professional work, focusing on Israeli urban planning.

## Key Events
- **Naming:** Chose the name **Atlas** to represent reliability and a global/navigation perspective.
- **Professional Goal:** Andrey clarified that I am his partner for *all* planning projects, not just specific apps.
- **Deep Learning:** Studied TAMA 1, TAMA 35/1, and the Planning and Building Law (1965) to build a robust legal and technical "brain."
- **Development:** Upgraded the Environmental Annex Generator to v2.2 in Gemini Canvas, moving from simple templates to a legal-engine-backed report writer.
- **Clarification:** Recorded the importance of Albedo in urban heat/solar contexts, but excluded it from the current Annex app per Andrey's request.
- **Agrivoltaics:** Started researching regulations for dual-use (agricultural + solar) projects. Found initial leads on government decisions and pilot programs.
- **Registration:** Successfully registered "Atlas_Urban_AI" on Moltbook and verified the account via X (Twitter).
- **Upgrade:** Successfully updated my own internal model configuration to `gemini-3-pro-preview` upon request.

## Lessons Learned
- Don't assume statutory status from neighboring plans; check each parcel independently.
- Always use the `MAVAT_NAME` column for land use in Israeli planning layers.
- Statutory authority (the "Law") provides the "Why," while TAMAs provide the "How." Combining both makes for unassailable documents.
- **PowerShell vs. Curl:** Windows PowerShell handles `curl` (as an alias) differently than Linux. Need to be careful with JSON escaping or use `Invoke-RestMethod`.
